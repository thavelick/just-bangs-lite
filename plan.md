# About Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create an about page at `./about/index.html` that explains Just Bangs Lite, provides project context, compares it with related tools, and shows the project timeline.

## Content Structure

### 1. What Just Bangs Lite Does
- Explain bang shortcuts (e.g., `python w!` → Wikipedia search)  
- Highlight key features: client-side, dependency-free, automatic dark mode
- Show example usage with screenshots or demos

### 2. GitHub Link
- Prominent link to the repository
- Include contributor information and how to contribute

### 3. Feature Comparison Grid
Comparison table showing Just Bangs Lite vs related bang redirect tools:

|---------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| **Architecture** | Client-side only | Python server | Client-side only | Server-side (global) |
| **Dependencies** | None (pure HTML/JS/CSS) | Python 3.10 | TypeScript, Vite, vite-plugin-pwa | N/A (hosted service) |
| **Deployment** | Static hosting | Server required | Static hosting | Global CDN |
| **Bang Source** | Built-in curated list | Downloads from DDG | Complete DDG bang list | Official bang database |
| **Custom Bangs** | Hard coded | ✅ custom-bang.js file | ❌ Not supported | ❌ Not supported |

| **Speed** | Instant (cached) | Local server speed | Instant (cached) | Network dependent |
| **Source Available** | Open source (AGPL v3) | Open source (AGPL v3) | Open source (MIT) | Proprietary |
| **Search Results** | Just bangs | Just bangs | Only bangs | Full search + bangs |

*You can use custom bangs with other locally self-hosted search engines

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
public_html/about/
├── index.html  (standalone page matching main site design)
└── style.css   (about page specific styles)
```

### Design Approach
- **Styling**: Extend existing `style.css` patterns or create inline styles that match
- **Layout**: Similar structure to main page but content-focused
- **Navigation**: Link back to main search page
- **Responsive**: Follow existing mobile-first approach
- **Dark Mode**: Inherit from main site's dark mode system

### Content Sections Layout
1. **Header**: "About Just Bangs Lite" with navigation
2. **Hero Section**: What it does + key benefits
3. **Feature Grid**: Visual comparison table
4. **Timeline**: Interactive or visual timeline
5. **GitHub Section**: Repository link + contribution info
6. **Footer**: Back to search link

## Future Maintenance
- Update feature comparisons when new features are added
- Update timeline with major milestones
- Keep GitHub information current
- Maintain consistency with main site design changes

## Notes
- This is primarily a content/documentation task rather than a code feature
- Focus on accuracy and clarity for users comparing these tools
- Keep content concise but informative
- Ensure the about page enhances rather than competes with the main search functionality
